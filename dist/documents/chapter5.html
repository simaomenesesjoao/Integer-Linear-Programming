<h2>5. Conclusion and additional notes</h2>
<p>The Simplex Method is one of the most popular and powerful ways to solve Linear Programming problems, and one of the goals of this article was to make it more accessible to people learning about it.</p>

<p>For the sake of simplicity I haven't mentioned some pathological but critical cases where the rules stated are not enough to reach an optimal vertex. This happens when several different bases share one single vertex. Granted, this is not possible in 2D where I focused most of my examples, but it can and does happen in 3D. For instance, the pointy bit at the intersection of the four triangular faces of a square pyramid is one such case.</p>

<p>I also did not comment on the algorithmic complexity of the Simplex algorithm. It is famously fast in practice (especially when compared to its brute-force counterpart mentioned in the beginning) but it can be exponentially bad in the worst case. The Klee-Minty hypercubes are the cannonical worst-case scenario for the Simplex algorithm, forcing it to visit <b>every single boundary vertex</b> and causing it to be exponential in the problem's dimensionality.</p>

<p>Moving forward, I'd like to cover these and other topics related to LP (like Integer Linear Programming). For the time being, however, I thought the topics covered here were already interesting enough to be made into interactive widgets and explained from my own ideas and understanding. Keep an eye out for further updates!</p>
